v11-bears-team-15 Quick Tech-Tips project

Our team will be working on the project aimed to share quick tips among users visiting the website. Tips will be primarily for the users from and interested in technologies, software, and computer science. Every user will be able to register/login, post a 280-character long tips and be able to intantly share their tips with all the users visiting the website. We plan to implement the like (maybe comments?) and share functionalities, profile management (adding your photo, bio, location, and website/github page). Registered users will be able to bookmark the tips that they liked.

This is the basic functionality that our team plans to implement. More functionality might be added later.
